**Diode Name - 1N4148

**Manufacturer - Central Semiconductor Corp.

** Data Sheet Link - https://my.centralsemi.com/datasheets/1N4148.PDF

**Forward Voltage at a specified current : For the 10mA forward current maximum voltage is 1V

**Maximum reverse voltage : Peak repetitive reverse voltage (VRRM) is 100 V, which represents the maximum reverse voltage the diode can withstand repeatedly without breakdown. 75 V also mentioned as Peak working reverse voltage and it is the recommended safe operating limit.

**Maximum Forward Current : 200mA. This the maximum safest current that diode can operate.

**Operating temperature range : -65 to +200 degree Celcius. In this range diode opeartes reliably.

**Application of Diode

The 1N4148's very fast reverse recovery time (~4 ns) makes it ideal for signal switching circuits like logic-level pulse shaping, frequency circuits, and digital interfaces where diodes must turn on/off quickly.
