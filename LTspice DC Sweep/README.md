## Assignment Title: Assignment 2.2 LTspice DC Sweep
**Student Name:** Madushan Rajapksha

**Tools Used:** LTspice
## Steps used in DC Sweep
**Click the run button in LTspice. Then go to DC sweep tab. Then select first source under that. Named the firs source as V1 according to the circuit.
Then select type of sweep as Linear. Start value as 0, Stop value as 15 and increment as 1. 

**The steps of graph is 1V (increment is 1)

## What Plot Shows?
** The ploted graphs shows the diode current as a function of voltage. Graph 1 shows the diode current as function of voltage source and graph 2 shows diode current as a function of diode voltage.
