# Reflection

From this lesson I learned the basic concepts of semiconductor materials and the operation of a p–n junction diode under forward and
reverse bias conditions. 

From this assignment I learned how thermal voltage depends on temperature and how to
apply the diode current equation correctly using proper units.
